#### Examples of Usage
**<u>Example 1</u>**<br>
Let's say you are currently at **PGP** and want to find out the buses you can board from **PGP** bus station to get to **NUS IT**.

To find all such bus routes:

1. Type <code>/route <strong>PGP</strong> /to <strong>NUS IT</strong></code> into the CLI and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> 
to execute the command as shown in the figure below.<br><br>
<img src="UG_Figures/routeInput1.png" alt="inputCommand" width=450><br>

2. The result will be a message displaying the list of buses you can take with their routes as shown in the figure below.<br><br>
<img src="UG_Figures/routeOutput1.png" alt="output" width=650><br>

**<u>Example 2</u>**<br>
Let's say you are currently at **University Health Centre** and you want to go to **PGPR**. But you accidentally type **"Univerity 
Health Center"** instead. 

These are the steps to follow: 

1. You type <code>/route <strong>Univerity Health Center</strong> /to <strong>PGPR</strong></code> into the CLI and 
press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute the command as done in example 1.

<img src="UG_Figures/routeOutput3.png" alt="FinalOutput" width=650><br>

### 3.3. Check bus route: ```/routemap```
This command displays the full route of the bus that you have specified.

Format: <code>/routemap <strong>bus code</strong></code> <br>

#### Examples of Usage
**<u>Example 1</u>**<br>
This command is exceptionally useful to find indirect bus routes.
Let us suppose that you are at **Raffles Hall** with only bus AA2 available and would like to go to **University Town**. 
You would notice that there is no direct bus to **University Town**. You could use the <code>/routemap</code> to find
indirect routes to your intended destination. 

To find indirect bus routes:

1. You type <code>/routemap <strong> AA2 </strong></code> into the CLI and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.<br><br>
<img src="UG_Figures/routemap4.png" alt="inputRouteMapCommand" width=650><br>

2. The result will display the whole bus route of bus AA2.<br><br>
<img src="UG_Figures/routemap1.png" alt="RouteMapCommand" width=650><br>

3. With the information that bus AA2 could bring you to bus stops after **Raffles Hall** e.g. **Kent Vale**, you can now check 
if there is a direct bus route from these bus stops.<br><br>
<img src="UG_Figures/routemap3.png" alt="inputRouteMapCommand" width=650><br>

**<u>Example 2</u>**<br>
This command is also useful in showing you the previous bus stops of your intended bus. You could use this information
to gauge how crowded the bus would be.<br><br>
Let us suppose that you are at **Raffles Hall** intending to board AA2. 

These are the steps to follow:

1. You type in <code>/routemap <strong> AA2 </strong></code> into the CLI and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.<br><br>
<img src="UG_Figures/routemap4.png" alt="inputRouteMapCommand" width=650><br>

2. The result will display the whole bus route of bus AA2. You will observe that the bus passes through **University Town**
which is relatively more crowded than other bus stops.<br><br>
<img src="UG_Figures/routemap1.png" alt="RouteMapCommand" width=650><br>

3. With this information, you could explore other bus routes to your destination.

### 3.4. Check for buses at a bus stop: ```/bus```

These are the steps to fix the mistake:

1. The result will be a message displaying bus stop suggestions for possible error in user input.<br><br>
<img src="UG_Figures/bus2.png"><br>

### 3.15. Similarity Checks
When you enter a location and make a spelling error or a typo in the name, the app performs a similarity check with 
existing location names and suggests some locations to you. The app executes this command automatically and does not 
require any explicit input from you.

#### Examples of Usage
Let's say you want to find all buses that stop at **Opp HSSML**, but you type <code>/bus <strong>Opp HSML</strong></code> instead.

You will receive a message with suggested location names you can use as shown in the figure below.<br><br>
<img src="UG_Figures/similarOutput1.png" alt="similar locs message" width = 550><br>

You may then type in the command again with the correct location to see a list of buses that stop at **Opp HSSML** 
as shown in the figure below.<br><br>
<img src="UG_Figures/similarOutput2.png" alt="Correct input message" width=400><br>

>Note: This check is only applicable to bus stop names, so the app performs it only when you enter a 
><code>/route</code> command or a <code>/bus</code> command. 

### 3.16. Reset frequent search data: ```/reset```
This command resets the data set used to display most frequently search bus stop on application start-up.

Format:<code>/reset</code>

#### Examples of usage
**<u>Example 1</u>**<br>
Let us suppose that you are transitioning to a new academic semester, and the locations that you will key in to the
application changes. To create a new data set that will cater to your needs in this new semester, you will key in the
command <code>/reset</code> to reset the data set and start the application on a clean slate.<br><br>
<img src="UG_Figures/freq1.png" alt="Correct input message" width=600><br>
